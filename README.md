# TempleJump
A Java clone of *Jump Knight*

The original files of this Java project were accidentally deleted. So the code here is decompiled code from the .jar exectuable. There are a lot of redundancies present due to the decompile of code. But some of the code is still usable for possible future use.

This is a sort of simple game to make that returns the most hours spent by the player. The player will be infuriated by the jumps and falls on their way up to the top. There is no save.
